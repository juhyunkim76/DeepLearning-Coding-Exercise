# DeepLearning-Coding-Exercise

Please note that this repository is for my own educational purpose. Source codes which are included in this repository are mainly from various books and other people's repositories.

The main source of codes and content are from the following sites: 
- https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en
- https://github.com/rghan/ISLR
- https://github.com/cran/AppliedPredictiveModeling/tree/master/inst/chapters
- https://github.com/rickiepark/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition


Most of the codes are almost identical to original ones because they have been re-written for hands on practice.
